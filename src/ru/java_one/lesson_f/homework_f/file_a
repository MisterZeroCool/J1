There is a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, I guess. I'm
the guy who can get it for you. Tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you are
partial to that,a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughter's high
school graduation, or anything else within reason, that is.
It wasn't always that way.
